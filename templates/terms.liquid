<p>Tickets are non-refundable. If you have booked a ticket and are no longer able to attend you have some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could let us know so that we can make your seat available to somebody else.</li>
<li>You could give / sell your ticket to someone else. If you choose to sell your ticket, we ask that you sell it at the price you paid for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, we would appreciate it if you could let us know so that we can keep our attendee list up to date.
