						<img src="{{ "speakers/chris-thorpe.jpg" | asset_url }}" alt="">
						<p>In a former life Chris spent four years studying for a chemistry degree and then another three researching for a PhD in structural and molecular biology. Part way through his PhD in 1992 he set up a website on his desktop machine using the recently released CERN webserver and he's been building websites ever since.</p>
						<p>	
						He's been responsible for web projects as diverse as the public consultation and display of sculpture on The Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, a video on demand archive for Nobel Prize Winners, the first ever Open Access science journal and the premiere of a James Bond film. He ran the technology team which built Moshi Monsters and helped to set up The Guardian Open Platform and the Government Digital Service. He is currently the consultant Chief Technology Officer of the Design and Artists Copyright Society.</p>
						<p>
						Recently he's been experimenting with crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, 3D scanning and 3D printing to build up a new venture called The Flexiscale Company which is experimenting in micro/mini manufacturing to make high resolution 3D printed plastic model kits of obscure railway items.
